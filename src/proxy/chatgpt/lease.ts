/**
 * The ChatGPT writer lease.
 *
 * Exactly one process may hold refresh authority for a ChatGPT account, at any
 * instant, forever. Refresh tokens are single-use: two processes exchanging one
 * do not produce a retry, they produce an account no amount of retrying
 * recovers. Everything below is shaped by that.
 *
 * The mechanism is Meridian's own, not a new dependency. `sessionStore.ts`
 * already publishes a lock as a fsynced staging file linked into place with
 * `linkSync` - atomic and no-replace, so two processes cannot both believe they
 * created it - and already decides abandonment with an OS-backed process
 * incarnation rather than a clock.
 *
 * THAT SECOND PART IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT. A time-based lease treats a
 * paused, swapping or descheduled holder as gone, and on a loaded machine that
 * is a routine occurrence rather than an exotic one. Here an expired heartbeat
 * only makes a lock a CANDIDATE; it is displaced solely when the OS says its
 * owner is gone (`processIncarnationIsDead`, which answers `dead` only on a
 * missing process or a different boot, and fails closed on everything else).
 *
 * A lock nobody can parse is therefore never reclaimed. That is deliberate:
 * refusing to start is recoverable by deleting a file, and spending another
 * process's single-use token is not.
