/**
 * ChatGPT usage windows to an absolute bench-until instant.
 *
 * Pure. Meridian's rotation already speaks in opaque profile ids and absolute
 * `until` timestamps (`routing.ts`), so nothing downstream needs to change -
 * what needs translating is the vocabulary, and the translation has two traps
 * in it.
 *
 * THE FIRST IS THAT POSITION DOES NOT IMPLY WIDTH. `rate_limit` carries a
 * `primary_window` and a `secondary_window`, and reading primary as "the
 * five-hour one" is wrong on four of the six accounts this was measured
 * against: pro and business-prolite both report their WEEKLY window as the
 * primary, free reports a 30-day one there, and only team uses the
 * 5h-primary / weekly-secondary layout. Width therefore comes from
 * `limit_window_seconds` and from nowhere else.
 *
 * THE SECOND IS THE UNIT. `reset_at` is epoch SECONDS - the reference
 * implementation multiplies it by 1000 and falls back to
 * `reset_after_seconds` only when it is absent. Read as milliseconds every
 * reset lands in 1970, every window looks long expired, and no account is
 * ever benched at all.
