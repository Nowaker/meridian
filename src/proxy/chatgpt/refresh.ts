/**
 * Exchanging a ChatGPT refresh token, as the only process allowed to.
 *
 * A refresh token is spent by being used, and its replacement exists nowhere
 * but in the response. So the failure this module is built around is not a
 * failed refresh - it is a SUCCESSFUL one whose replacement was never written
 * down. That account is then unreachable by any amount of retrying, and only
 * an interactive login brings it back.
 *
 * Three rules follow, and every branch below is one of them:
 *
 *   PROVE YOU CAN WRITE BEFORE YOU SPEND. The intent to exchange is committed
 *   to disk first. A process that cannot record the result never dispatches.
 *
 *   COMMIT BEFORE YOU RETURN. A caller can only obtain the new access token
 *   from a write that already reached disk, so there is no window in which the
 *   rotated token lives only in memory.
 *
 *   NEVER RETRY WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPENT. If a dispatched exchange's outcome
 *   cannot be established, the stamp survives and every later attempt reports
 *   the account as needing a human. Retrying is what converts "we may have
 *   lost the replacement" into a reused token and a dead account.
 *
 * The stamp is cleared only by the commit that records a result, or when the
 * provider states it declined to process the grant at all. That asymmetry is
 * deliberate: a 429 must not brand an account, and an unexplained silence must.
