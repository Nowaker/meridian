/**
 * Which ChatGPT credential source an instance runs, decided once at creation.
 *
 * `MERIDIAN_CHATGPT_CREDENTIALS`:
 *   - `follow-external`: read the oc-codex-multi-auth store
 *     (`MERIDIAN_CODEX_POOL_PATH`) read-only; never refresh, never write.
 *   - `owned`: Meridian's own store with the refresh lease, taken at startup
 *     even while the store is empty. Seats are signed in through the web UI
 *     (chatgpt/login.ts); until one is, a GPT request is answered with an
 *     error saying so rather than routed to Claude.
 *   - `off`: no ChatGPT backend; GPT model names keep meaning Claude.
 *   - unset: `owned` when Meridian's own store holds accounts, else off - so
 *     an instance nobody configured for ChatGPT behaves exactly as before.
