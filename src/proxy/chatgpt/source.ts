/**
 * Where the ChatGPT backend gets its seats and access tokens.
 *
 * Two implementations, chosen once per instance:
 *
 * - `owned` (owned.ts): Meridian's own store. Meridian holds the single
 *   writer lease and is the only process that refreshes these tokens.
 * - `follow-external` (external.ts): the oc-codex-multi-auth store, read-only.
 *   Its owner refreshes; Meridian only reads access tokens and never writes
 *   the file, its locks, or the token endpoint.
 *
 * The backend never learns which one it holds beyond `mode`, which it uses
 * only to word the error a client sees when nothing can serve.
 *
 * Nothing on this interface returns a refresh token, and `seats()` returns no
 * token at all, so a view built from it cannot leak one.
