/**
 * The outbound ChatGPT request, built from nothing.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no config, no inbound request. That last one is the point
 * rather than a convenience. The reference implementation starts from the
 * CLIENT's headers and deletes what it does not want, which is safe only
 * while the delete list keeps pace with everything clients send. Building
 * from an empty Headers inverts that: a header reaches the provider because
 * it is named below, and for no other reason.
 *
 * The origin is a compile-time constant with no override. An operator-supplied
 * base URL would let a bearer token be aimed at an arbitrary host, and the
 * token in question belongs to a subscription rather than to the operator.
