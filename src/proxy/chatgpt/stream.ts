/**
 * Did this ChatGPT response fail, and is another account worth trying?
 *
 * Meridian answers the same question for Anthropic in `sniffAccountFailure`
 * (`server.ts`), which reads ONE complete frame and lets it decide, because an
 * Anthropic error stream leads with `event: error`. A Responses stream always
 * leads with `response.created`, so that rule reads the preamble of a doomed
 * stream and calls it healthy. This scans further.
 *
 * WHERE IT STOPS IS THE ENTIRE DESIGN. Scanning too little misses a failure
 * that was two frames away; scanning too far means retrying a turn whose
 * output the client already holds, which bills a second account for work that
 * was already delivered. So the scan runs while the stream is still saying
 * nothing - and stops the instant a frame carries anything a client could
 * render. A failure after that point belongs to the client.
 *
 * An unrecognized frame counts as output. That is the fail-safe direction:
 * treating an unknown event as more preamble would keep scanning past
 * something that might have been content.
 *
 * A failure record carries a classification and a status and nothing else.
 * The provider's own wording reaches the CLIENT through the passthrough,
 * where it is useful; it is kept out of the value Meridian logs and stores.
