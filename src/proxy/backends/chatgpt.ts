/**
 * The ChatGPT upstream backend: one complete provider request, passed through.
 *
 * The upstream already speaks Responses, so nothing is translated. The body is
 * adapted only where the Codex backend requires it (chatgpt/body.ts) and the
 * response stream comes back byte for byte. This path never enters the Claude
 * pipeline: no adapter detection, no system-prompt handling, no plugin
 * `onRequest`/`onResponse` hooks - which is what keeps a Claude-oriented
 * plugin such as opencode-scrub from rewriting a ChatGPT request. It is still
 * observed: every client turn produces one `ChatGptTurnEvent` for telemetry.
 *
 * Both directions are contained. Outbound headers are built from nothing
 * (chatgpt/request.ts), so nothing the client sent reaches the provider but
 * the body; and only an allowlist of response headers comes back, so a client
 * is never handed chatgpt.com's cookies.
 *
 * Seats and tokens come from a `ChatGptCredentialSource` (owned or
 * follow-external). What is decided here is rotation: try a seat, read far
 * enough into the answer to know whether the SEAT failed, and move on if it
 * did. Retrying stops where the failure sniffer stops - after the client could
 * have seen output, serving the turn again would bill a second account for the
 * same work.
 *
 * Hook points for later features (Max Budget, fallback model, pricing) are the
 * `hooks` option; see ChatGptHooks.
