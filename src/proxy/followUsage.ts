/**
 * Follow another instance's usage figures — the companion to followActive.ts.
 *
 * Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint is rate limited per account, and that
 * budget is shared by every process holding the account's credentials. Two
 * Meridian instances on one box therefore compete for it: measured here, a
 * second instance polling ten accounts got 429 on all ten, indefinitely,
 * while the first kept fetching normally. The loser has no way to tell that
 * apart from a broken account by looking at its own result.
 *
 * So a follower does not ask Anthropic at all. It reads the figures the
 * instance it already follows has ALREADY paid for, over the same loopback
 * connection it uses for the active profile, and reports them as its own.
 * One poll covers every profile, so the cost to the followed instance is one
 * cached read per interval no matter how many accounts exist.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a general cache-sharing mechanism: it is on only
 * under MERIDIAN_FOLLOW_ACTIVE, which already declares "that instance is the
 * authority and I am the copy".
 *
 * Degradation matches followActive.ts: the poll is background, the request
 * path never waits on it, and a follower with no followed figures falls
 * straight through to its own credential read. Being unable to reach the
 * followed instance must not be worse than not following at all.
 *
 * Leaf module — no imports from server.ts, session/ or profiles.ts. The
 * oauthUsage import is types-only, so there is no runtime cycle with the
 * module that consumes this one.

 * Deliberately much longer than the followed instance's own 30s usage cache.
 * Polling AT that cache's TTL would find it expired almost every time and so
 * would make the followed instance fetch from Anthropic on our behalf, once
 * per profile, forever — trading a follower that competes for the rate limit
 * for a follower that drives the other instance into it instead. Measured on
 * a ten-account box, a 30s poll means twenty upstream fetches a minute that
 * nobody asked for.
 *
 * Usage percentages move over hours, so a two-minute cadence loses nothing
 * that anyone can see, and FOLLOW_USAGE_MAX_AGE_MS still covers several
 * consecutive failures before the figures are withdrawn.
