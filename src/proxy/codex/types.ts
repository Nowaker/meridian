/**
 * Wire and internal types for the read-only ChatGPT (Codex) usage integration.
 *
 * NOTE: agent-specific. This integration reads a file owned by the
 * oc-codex-multi-auth OpenCode plugin and calls undocumented
 * `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/*` endpoints. Both can change independently of
 * Meridian, so every field below is validated at the boundary and degrades to
 * null rather than propagating a surprise. Keep this coupling inside
 * `src/proxy/codex/` — do not spread it into adapters or the existing OAuth
 * usage path.
 *
 * The window vocabulary mirrors `OAuthUsageWindow` in `../oauthUsage`
 * structurally — `utilization` is a 0..1 consumed fraction, `resetsAt` is epoch
 * milliseconds — so the dashboard renders a Codex window with the helpers it
 * already has. It is a separate declaration rather than a shared import
 * because Codex must not depend on the Claude-specific usage module.
