/**
 * Upstream-idle guard for proxied model streams.
 *
 * Wraps the provider SDK's streaming async iterable and enforces a maximum gap
 * between *real* upstream messages. If the source goes silent for longer than
 * `idleMs` — before the first chunk (slow TTFB) or mid-stream — the guard
 * aborts iteration and throws `UpstreamIdleError`. SDK `stream_event/ping`
 * messages are discarded: they prove transport liveness, not model progress.
 *
 * Why this is needed: the proxy emits downstream SSE heartbeats (`: ping`) on a
 * fixed interval, which resets the *client's* (pi's) byte-level idle timer. A
 * stalled upstream is therefore invisible to the client and would wedge the
 * turn forever. This guard is the authoritative upstream-liveness check.
 *
 * COORDINATION CONTRACT (Pylon Orchestrator): this guard owns *model-stream*
 * liveness. Pylon's runtime stall watchdog is only a BACKSTOP for the
 * model-wait gap with no tool in flight, and keeps its abort threshold above
 * this guard's idle limit so the two layers never race to abort the same hung
 * model. The limit is `MERIDIAN_UPSTREAM_IDLE_MS` (default 90s, set in
 * server.ts); Pylon warns at 120s and aborts at 180s. Any override must stay
 * BELOW Pylon's STALL_ABORT_MS; raising it past 180s requires changing Pylon
 * first.
 * Note `MERIDIAN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is a different knob — the HTTP
 * keep-alive timeout — and has no bearing on this contract. See
 * pylon-orchestrator/docs/circuit/specs/stall-watchdog-tool-exempt.md.

 *
 * A late timer suggests delayed callbacks, for example from a synchronous
 * fsync or a long CPU burst on the main thread. While the loop is
 * blocked the upstream keeps sending, and its bytes wait in the socket or
 * pipe. When the loop resumes, expired timers run before the I/O poll that
 * would deliver those bytes, so without this check a live stream is rejected
 * as silent. The two-second threshold excludes ordinary short timer jitter;
 * it is not proof of a particular cause. Crossing it adds only a bounded I/O
 * opportunity, without extending the idle window or accepting transport pings.
