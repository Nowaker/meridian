/**
 * Task 4 - the ChatGPT writer lease.
 *
 * The constraint this exists to satisfy is that EXACTLY ONE PROCESS may hold
 * refresh authority for a ChatGPT account, at any instant, forever. ChatGPT
 * refresh tokens are single-use: two processes exchanging the same token do
 * not produce a retry, they produce an account that no amount of retrying
 * recovers - only a human logging in again.
 *
 * Every exclusion test here therefore uses a REAL SECOND OS PROCESS. An
 * in-process guard would pass while protecting nothing, and this repo already
 * contains the cautionary example: tokenRefresh.ts holds a Map and a WeakMap
 * that look like mutual exclusion and are confined to one process. Anthropic
 * tolerates that because its refresh tokens survive reuse. ChatGPT will not.
